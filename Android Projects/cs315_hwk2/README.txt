/**********************************************************************
* What does your program do? Include a brief description!
***********************************************************************/

MS Paint, but on Android.
It can draw circles, rectangles, change colors, bucket 'fill', etc.



/**********************************************************************
* Is there anything I need to know about building and running your app?
***********************************************************************/

Not really, it's all self explanatory. Point mode does single points.  Lines do lines
from first click to the next.  And so forth.  About building my code: my floodFill method
works only to a degree.  For some reason, it only fills the 'bottom' (top from our perspective).
I believe that when I call 'pop', it's not iterating my 'starter' correctly and completely ignoring
some stored locations.



/**********************************************************************
* Did you add any extensions to the assignment that I should be aware

***********************************************************************/

Nope



/**********************************************************************
* Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete assignment?
***********************************************************************/

About 10...and it still isn't technically done.  Floodfill doesn't want to cooperate.



/**********************************************************************
 * Describe any serious problems you encountered in this assignment.
 * What was hard, or what should we warn students about in the future?
 * How can I make this assignment better?
 **********************************************************************/

Floodfill is pretty confusing to implement.  That's about it.  Everything else is simple...
to an extent.  My circle isn't perfect, but at least they're no longer square like.

N/A  Floodfill is my bane.
