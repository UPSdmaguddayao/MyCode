/**********************************************************************
* What is your artwork called? Include a brief (couple sentence) 
* description of the piece (like what you might find on a placard next 
* to a painting in a museum).
***********************************************************************/

This is a Mickey Mouse head.  A very iconic symbol from the childhood of many.
Holds value in one's heart, not wallet.


/**********************************************************************
* Is there anything I need to know about building and running your app
* (API or device target level, etc)? Note that the UI should be self-
* explanatory.
***********************************************************************/

If you somehow find the destroy the world button without cheating, I'll be amazed.
This buttons are self explanatory.  When default (no buttons pressed), it's Disney at 100% size and white
background.  Running the app is simple, the code is just long
The API is made for API17 for an Nexus 4.


/**********************************************************************
* In the space below, include a brief (couple sentence) justification 
* of and reflection on your user interface design. Why did you lay it 
* out the way you did? How does your app follow GUI design guidelines 
* and principles?
***********************************************************************/

The design was similar to what it was before hand.  I only changed what it can
turn into.  I laid all the changes that will be done to the "artwork" at the bottom of the screen
not deter from the overall visual.  Anything that is next to each other affects one another.  Should follow
the GUI design guidelines since anyone who doesn't know about it can easily follow
how it works.



/**********************************************************************
* Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete assignment?
***********************************************************************/

About 9 hours.  A lot of it (about 4) was reading the tutorial and applying it.
I did ask some dumb questions back and forth to make sure I was doing it right.


/**********************************************************************
 * Describe any serious problems you encountered in this assignment.
 * What was hard, or what should we warn students about in the future?
 * How can I make this assignment better?
 **********************************************************************/

It's hard if you have no idea what you're doing.  I still don't know how to alter
the display yet.  Though, the tutorial is a big help in understanding.  Though, I'll
need to review it more often to get a sense of how to create an app more often


/**********************************************************************
 * List any other comments (about the assignment or your submission) 
 * here. Feel free to provide any feedback on what you learned from 
 * doing the assignment, whether you enjoyed doing it, etc.
 **********************************************************************/

The tutorial helped a bit while creating this, but I still am confused about the "Intent"
function.  I also don't know how to apply changes to the Canvas onto the Android that well
other than forcing code into the DrawingView and brute forcing my way through.  It's been
a while since I've coded using the Canvas, so it's been a good refresher.
