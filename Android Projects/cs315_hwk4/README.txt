I couldn't find a way to implement hierarchical transformations correctly.  I'll take my 20% off, but
I couldn't figure it out in the time I had left (read the hierarchical note a bit too late)

Despite the hierarchical transformations, I had fun with this assignment.  But for some reason,
stacks didn't work properly for me.  When I pushed my stack, they didn't work the way they wanted.
I gave up and left things the way they are (with forced transformations).  I misread how to do the hierarchy so
that's why that happened.  (I attempted the hierarchy after establishing what it looks like with mTemp)
