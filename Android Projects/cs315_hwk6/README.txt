/**********************************************************************
* Include a brief description of your rendered scene (what am I 
* looking at)?
***********************************************************************/

It's 4 spheres reflecting one another (only twice) with two triangles forming
a shadowed square in the background.



/**********************************************************************
* What is the approximate rendering time for one frame of your scene?
* In Java? In Android? How might you improve Android's rendering time?
***********************************************************************/

As of right now, I render one frame in 385ms (less than 2FPS :( ).  It's not optimal,
but it makes due for now



/**********************************************************************
* Did you add any extensions to the assignment?
***********************************************************************/

No extensions, too hard to do it in the time I have left



/**********************************************************************
* Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete assignment?
***********************************************************************/

I'd like to say around 14 hours?  A lot of things tended not to work and I
had to go back…a lot



/**********************************************************************
 * Describe any serious problems you encountered in this assignment.
 * What was hard, or what should we warn students about in the future?
 * How can I make this assignment better?
 **********************************************************************/

Code not working.  Thank god the debugger helped catch errors

 **********************************************************************/

It was a nice assignment.  Not too hard (other than implementation), but not
definitely not easy.  After I got everything to work…I hit myself for getting the wrong 
equations
